# ASSIGNMENT 2 - INDUSTRY VISIT AT UTM DIGITAL VIDEO
On 20 December 2023, we attended an industrial visit at UTM Digital which is one of the mandatory tasks for the TIS course. Before attending the activity, we were given a talk about the importance of UTM Digital and how it works. During the activity, we were given a more detailed explanation and could see the atmosphere of the office which is divided into several departments. We have also interviewed the staff there by asking some questions related to UTM Digital.
