# PC ASSEMBLE (LAB)
On December 6, 2023, we did a PC assemble activity which is a mandatory activity for all students taking the Technology and Information System course. After completing the activity, we have to answer the quiz related to the activity. The activities are carried out according to the respective groups.

# REFLECTION
As a computer science student, the PC assembly activity gave me insightful knowledge and practical skills that are essential to my future academic and professional success. It first underlined the value of cooperation and clear communication. Working together with my groupmate to build a PC meant that I had to constantly make sure that every part was connected and positioned correctly.

Second, the exercise helped me understand the importance of being patient and persistent when solving problems. As we ran into unexpected issues during the assembly process, I came to understand that dealing with difficulties is a typical part of working in computer science. This practical experience reaffirmed the value of critical thinking and maintaining composure in the face of technical challenges. In computer science, where troubleshooting and solution finding are fundamental to the field, these problem-solving abilities are critical to success.

In summary, the PC assembly practical provided me with more than just technical knowledge. It instilled in me the importance of effective communication, teamwork, and the ability to persist through challenges all of which are invaluable skills as I continue my journey as a computer science student and, eventually, as a professional in the field
