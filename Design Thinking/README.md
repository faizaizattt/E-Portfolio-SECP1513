# DESIGN THINKING
Design thinking is a process of critical thinking used to develop solutions to problems through collaboration, innovation and design. Design thinking helps prepare us for a world where skills such as teamwork, problem solving, communication, analysis, creativity and the ability to influence others is becoming increasingly important in the work force. We need to record and document all the process in design thinking which empathy, define, ideate, prototype and testing. 

# REFLECTION
My experience with this design thinking project has greatly improved my comprehension and problem-solving skills. Once I had the problem defined, I could see the gap between what users want and what is currently available. Coming up with ideas was fun and tested my creative thinking during the Ideate phase. When it came time to build the prototype, I could see the potential for a software solution that would actually make a difference. I can see how important it is to get feedback from real users as we move into the Test phase. I've learned from this project how crucial it is to be innovative, user-focused, and constantly improving in order to deliver a solution that genuinely meets users' expectations.
