# ASSIGNMENT 1 - Overview On NALI Event
On November 5, 2023, we were tasked with preparing a report reviewing posters showcased
at NALI 2023, organized by UTM and spanning two days on November 7 and 8. The event's
primary objective was to promote innovative teaching and learning practices in education.
Our attendance on November 8 allowed us to engage with presenters from diverse
backgrounds and countries, gaining valuable insights into education, particularly in the realm
of ICTâ€”an area specified by our lecturer for our assignment on ICT in teaching and learning
systems.
