# ASSIGNMENT 3 - Report Of Overview On NALI 2023 Event
On November 5, 2023, we were tasked with preparing a report reviewing posters showcased
at NALI 2023, organized by UTM and spanning two days on November 7 and 8. The event's
primary objective was to promote innovative teaching and learning practices in education.
Our attendance on November 8 allowed us to engage with presenters from diverse
backgrounds and countries, gaining valuable insights into education, particularly in the realm
of ICT—an area specified by our lecturer for our assignment on ICT in teaching and learning
systems.

# REFLECTION
Participating in the NALI 2023 poster exploration has been an eye-opening journey into the exciting world of educational innovation. I had the chance to dive into a variety of posters that showcased how technology and teaching methods come together to improve education. Each poster offered a fresh perspective, featuring cool things like augmented reality in classrooms, AI-powered debates, and even inclusive maze games. It was amazing to see how these initiatives aren't just about using tech for the sake of it but are genuinely focused on making learning more engaging and preparing students for the future.

Engaging with presenters and digging into the details of each poster gave me valuable insights into the role of Information and Communication Technology in education. It's clear that these projects are driven by a commitment to overcoming challenges, nurturing critical thinking, and creating dynamic learning environments. What's even more exciting is that these ideas aren't confined to one type of education – they can be adapted and applied across different settings, showing the universal impact of innovative teaching practices. As I reflect on this experience, these posters serve as inspiring examples of what can happen when technology and pedagogy come together, shaping the future of teaching and learning. NALI 2023 has truly provided a platform to celebrate these advancements and contribute to the ongoing evolution of education practices.
